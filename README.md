## Technical

XSSnake is written using HTML5 and JavaScript. It works in all browsers that
support Canvas and Websocket. XSSnake uses Node.js and ws for the server
and Google Closure Compiler to compile to minified and optimized code.

XSSnake is not production-ready yet.

## Developing and Testing

 * Access the game by opening `client/debug.html` in your browser

Running unit tests:

If you add client JavaScript files, or add/modify levels or audio, you need
to rebuild files by running `grunt source`.
